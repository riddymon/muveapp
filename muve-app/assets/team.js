      "I have over 20 years of experience as a Registered Massage Therapist (RMT) in Ontario, having worked at several multi-disciplinary clinics in Kingston, Ottawa and Kitchener. I graduated with honours in 2000 from Canadian Therapeutic College in Burlington, Ontario with a Massage Therapy Diploma, under the educational requirements of the CMTO. In terms of my practice, I believe that the specific needs of each individual client should be treated in the way that best supports their overall wellbeing and functioning. I strongly believe in the integration of various health disciplines and welcome the opportunity to tailor specific treatment programs to the needs of the individual client together with other health care professionals. I have a unique talent that allows me to give a treatment with significant pressure but includes a deep relaxation effect on the body. I prefer to work with people of all ages providing assessment and treatment focusing on postural dysfunctions (hereditary or lifestyle) reducing pain, improving range of motion and quality of life. I am part of the triOS College faculty and passionately support my secondary profession in therapeutic recreation.",
